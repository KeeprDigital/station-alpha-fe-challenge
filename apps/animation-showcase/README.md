# Button Animation Challenge

This project challenges you to create a reusable animated button component in React. The goal is to recreate a button that includes several animation effects while maintaining good accessibility practices.

## Challenge Requirements

### Key Features

1. **Hover Animation**: Create a smooth animation effect when hovering over the button
2. **Reusable Component**: Make the button reusable and customizable
3. **Icon Support**: Add support for optional icons with their own animations
4. **Size Variants**: Implement different size variants (small, medium, large)
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure the button respects reduced motion preferences

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd apps/animation-showcase`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Open your browser to the displayed URL (http://localhost:3331)

### Tips

- Study the animation description provided in the example
- Use styled-components for styling and animations
- Consider using CSS transitions, transforms, and pseudo-elements
- Test your button with different content and sizes
- Implement motion reduction using the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

1. **Visual Accuracy**: How closely your button matches the animation example
2. **Code Quality**: Clean, well-organized, and commented code
3. **Component Design**: Is the component reusable and properly typed?
4. **Accessibility**: Does the component handle reduced motion preferences?
5. **Browser Compatibility**: Does the animation work across major browsers?

## Submission

Create a pull request with your solution. Ensure your PR includes:

1. The completed button component
2. Any necessary documentation
3. Proper commit history

Good luck!
