# API Integration Challenge - Questions

Please answer the following questions about your weather application implementation:

## API Selection and Integration

1. Which weather API did you choose for this project and why?

2. How did you structure your API service layer? Explain your approach to organizing API calls.

3. What challenges did you face when integrating with the weather API, and how did you overcome them?

4. How did you handle API rate limiting and ensure efficient use of API calls?

## User Experience Design

5. Explain your approach to designing the weather data visualization. How did you determine the most effective way to present the data?

6. How did you implement the search functionality, including the autocomplete/suggestions feature?

7. Describe how you designed the application to handle different types of weather conditions and alerts.

8. What user preferences or customization options did you implement in your weather app? Why did you choose these specific options?

## Technical Implementation

9. How did you implement client-side caching for API responses? What strategy did you use?

10. Explain your approach to error handling for API requests. How do you handle network errors, invalid inputs, or API-specific errors?

11. How did you implement the weather map feature? Which mapping library did you use and why?

12. If you implemented real-time updates, explain your approach and any considerations for optimizing performance.

## Performance Optimization

13. What performance optimizations did you implement in your application?

14. How did you handle loading states to provide a good user experience during API requests?

15. What strategies did you use to minimize the number of API calls while keeping data fresh?

16. Did you implement any lazy loading or code splitting techniques? If so, explain your approach.

## Responsiveness and Accessibility

17. How did you ensure your application is responsive across different screen sizes?

18. What accessibility features did you implement, and how did you test them?

19. How does your application handle offline scenarios or poor connectivity?

## Testing and Quality Assurance

20. What approach did you take to testing your application?

21. How did you test the API integration specifically?

22. If you encountered edge cases during testing, what were they and how did you handle them?

## Reflection

23. What was the most challenging aspect of this project and how did you overcome it?

24. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you add to the application?

25. What did you learn from implementing this weather application that you would apply to future projects?
