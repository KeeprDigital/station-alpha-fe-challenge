# Bug Hunting Challenge

This React application has been intentionally designed with several bugs that need fixing. Your task is to identify and fix these issues to make the application work correctly.

## The Application

This is a Todo List application with the following features:
- Add new todo items
- Mark todos as complete/incomplete
- Delete todos
- Filter todos (All, Active, Completed)
- Clear all completed todos

## Challenge Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies and run the app
3. Identify and fix all bugs in the application
4. Answer the questions in the `questions.md` file
5. Create a PR with your fixes

## Bugs to Find

There are several types of bugs in this application, ranging from simple type errors to logical flaws in state management. You might find that linters (like ESLint) or the TypeScript compiler highlight some issues, while others will require testing the application's behavior and analyzing the code logic.

Look for bugs related to:

- Functionality (the app doesn't work as described)
- State management (incorrect updates, mutations)
- Type safety (missing or incorrect types)
- Component interaction (incorrect props, missing data)
- Potential performance issues or inefficiencies

Your task is to identify and fix these issues to make the application function correctly according to the feature list.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the app
npm run dev
```

## Evaluation Criteria

You will be evaluated on:

1. **Bug identification**: How many issues you find
2. **Bug fixing**: The quality of your solutions
3. **Code quality**: Clarity, organization, and maintainability
4. **Explanation**: How well you describe the bugs and your fixes in `questions.md`

## Submission

1. Create a branch with your name (e.g., `john-doe-bug-fixes`)
2. Commit your changes with clear commit messages
3. Push your branch and create a Pull Request
4. Make sure you've completed the `questions.md` file

Good luck!
