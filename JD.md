## About the Role

We are looking for a front-end engineer who understands the reasoning behind frameworks, not just how to use them. Someone who has experience across different approaches, avoids unnecessary dependencies, and thrives on solving real product challenges related to performance, scale, and real-time interfaces.

You will contribute across our product suite, including trading, payments, registration, and internal tools. This is a hands-on role where you will help shape architecture and user experience from the ground up, not just deliver interfaces.

- **Build Tools:** Vite, Webpack
- **Testing:** Playwright, Jest
- **CI/CD:** Bitbucket Pipelines, Git
- **Infrastructure:** AWS (Lambda, API Gateway)

## Key Responsibilities

- **Development and Maintenance:** Develop, optimize, and maintain user interfaces for trading platforms, financial applications, and internal tools.
- **Tech Selection:** Choose and implement front-end technologies best suited to each project with a focus on scalability, performance, and user experience.
- **Complex UI and UX:** Work with real-time data flows and interactive experiences in trading and payment contexts.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Translate product and design requirements into robust and responsive interfaces.
- **Agile Participation:** Take part in sprint planning, standups, and retrospectives to deliver iteratively.
- **Project Leadership:** Drive projects from setup through delivery, shaping architecture and execution in collaboration with the team.

## Core Projects

- **Asset Management:** Interface for a data-rich dashboard using Sharesight, Open Banking, and brokerage APIs.
- **Trading Platform:** Gamified interface with real-time price updates, countdowns, and animated visual feedback.
- **Payments Gateway App:** React-based app integrating with multiple vendors for payments processing and account flows.
- **Registration and Accounts:** Sign-up, login, KYC workflows, and account dashboard interfaces.
- **Back Office Tools:** Admin-facing apps to support customer service and internal workflows, especially related to payments.

## Qualifications

- Solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, including DOM, asynchronous behavior, and rendering logic.
- Proficiency in HTML5, CSS3, and TypeScript, with deep experience in React and confidence across multiple frameworks.
- Familiarity with build tools such as Vite and Webpack.
- Strong skills in responsive design and performance optimization.
- Experience working with real-time APIs and data-driven UIs.
- Knowledge of testing tools like Playwright or Jest.
- Version control and CI/CD experience using Git and Bitbucket Pipelines.

## Core Attributes

- **Ownership and Accountability:** You take initiative, manage your work independently, and communicate progress clearly.
- **Communication:** You explain technical choices well and work closely with design and product teams.
- **Framework Agnostic:** You focus on solving problems using the best tool for the job, not just your favorite stack.
- **Product-Oriented:** You care about delivering thoughtful and polished experiences that users enjoy.
- **Problem Solver:** You like working through edge cases, real-world constraints, and system interactions.
